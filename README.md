Create a Ruby on Rails application that would allow a coordinator to track participants across multiple registries.

A registry is uniquely identified by:

name
location
Registry can be in an open or a closed state.

Each registry, can have multiple coordinators where each coordinator is identified uniquely by their email address. Coordinators also have:

name
phone number
Same coordinator can be assigned to multiple registries.

Participant is identified by:

name
gender
date of birth
A participant can be enrolled in multiple open registries. But, they can't be enrolled on a same registry more than once.

For contacting a participant later, during enrollment following information is needed:

date of enrollment
method of contact (phone or email)
remarks
coordinator that performed the enrollment.
As a user, coordinator should be able to setup registries and manage associated coordinators.

A coordinator can manage all coordinators and participants.

Coordinator can enroll participants into a registry and see the list of participants for a given registry, grouped by the coordinator that enrolled them.

Authentication/Authorization is not required.
